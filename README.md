PebbleBucks 3.1
===============

PebbleBucks is an app for the [Pebble Smartwatch](https://getpebble.com) that allows easy access to your Starbucks account information and card barcodes.

Based on [PebbleBucks 2.0 by Neal](https://github.com/Neal/PebbleBucks) and the [original PebbleBucks by Matt Donders](https://github.com/mattdonders/PebbleBucks).

## Security

PebbleBucks uses the Starbucks [OAuth API](http://oauth.net). Your access token and secret are sent securely to a Heroku server that communicates directly with Starbucks. The source is available in the `heroku` branch.
